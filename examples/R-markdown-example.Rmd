### Using previewing-mode with knitr

We can also process multi-step operations. An `.Rmd` file is processed
first into a Markdown file and then into an HTML file, but the
`knit2html` function in the `knitr` does both steps. This is easily
configured like so: You could set up this build by adding something
like this to your `.emacs.d`:

```

(add-to-list
 'previewing-build-command-list
 `("\\(.*\\)\\.[Rr]md$"
   ("R" "-e"
    "library(knitr); knit2html(commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)[[1]])"
    "\\&") "\\1.html"))

```



```{r testing}

x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y, type="l")

```
